# Sequencer

Hi! Thanks for dropping by. Initially I just wanted the play around with the Web Audio Api, but the project went a bit out of control and I ended up building a little sequencer. The same goes for the code base..it is a bit of a mess to say the least. Please note that the app runs best on a laptop/desktop, because some of the functionalities are disabled for mobile devices. I hope you will have fun playing around with this sequencer! :)
